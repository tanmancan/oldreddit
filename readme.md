Redirects new Reddit to old Reddit. Not affiliated with Reddit.

Don't like the new reddit redesign? Wish you could go back to using the old reddit site? This extension is just what you need! It will automatically redirect the new reddit to old.reddit.com. So you can have that comforting familiar look back, just like the old days.
